- `Codeforces Rating 900` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 900
- `Codeforces Rating 1000` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1000
- `Codeforces Rating 1100` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1100
- `Codeforces Rating 1200` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1200
- `Codeforces Rating 1300` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1300
- `Codeforces Rating 1400` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1400
- `Codeforces Rating 1500` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1500
- `Codeforces Rating 1600` – Problems with a difficulty rating of 1600
- `.vscode` – Editor settings for consistent formatting and environment

## 🚀 Languages Used

- **C++** – 60%
- **Python** – 40%

## 📌 How to Use

Each folder contains source code files for problems solved from Codeforces. You can:

1. **Browse by difficulty level** – Start with easier problems (800-900) and gradually work your way up
2. **Open individual files** to view the solution approach and implementation
3. **Run locally** to test or modify solutions
4. **Study algorithms** – Each solution demonstrates specific problem-solving techniques

### Running C++ Solutions
```bash
# Compile and run a C++ file
g++ -o solution "filename.cpp"
./solution
```

### Running Python Solutions
```bash
# Run a Python file
python3 "filename.py"
```

## 🛠 Requirements

- C++17 or later (for C++ files)
- Python 3.6+ (for Python files)
- Codeforces account (for practicing online)
